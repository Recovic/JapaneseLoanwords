# Transliterator for loanwords in Japanese

As globalization going on, the influence of English continues to permeate other languages, and Japanese is a classic example. For new concepts, modern Japanese usually transliterate these words, and they are known as loanwords. This repository provides a two-way automatic transliteration method between Japanese and English to translate new words that are not in the dictionary. The English-to-Japanese transliteration section divides English words into units and translates each unit into Japanese, and then combines them. The same letters that appear in different English words usually have to be converted into different Japanese, so both English and Japanese context information must be considered to calculate the rationality of the conversion. The Japanese-to-English transliteration is completed by calculating the probability of the English unit candidate, and the target English context information is used to calculate the probability of Japanese-to-English conversion.
